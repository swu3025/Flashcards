### App Description
This app is a flashcard app that contains a question on the screen of the the app with three answer choices below. The user of the app has two options: directly reveal the answer to the question or click on the answer choices below. To directly access the answer, the user is able to tap on the question box, which will cause the question box to be replace with the answer box. To go back to the question box, the user can simply tap on the answer box. If the answer choice tapped on is wrong, the answer choice will disappear. If the answer choice tapped on is the correct answer, the question box will be replace with the answer box and the answer choice will have a cyan background, removing all of the answer choices except for the correct one. Once the correct answer is chosen, a reset button will appear below. When clicked on, the button will bring the user back to the screen with the question and the three answers choices. The user is also able to change the questions and answer choices by either clicking plus sign on the bottom, which will lead the user to a screen with boxes where the user can fill out the questions and answer choices he/she wants to use for the flashcard app. On the top of the screen, there is  a navigation bar with two buttons: cancel and done. The cancel button is used for if the user decides not to change the question and answers. The done button is used for when the user is done filling out the questions and answer choices and is ready to make the changes. The user has the choice to leave the extra answer choices blank (The extra choices that are left blank are given a default string of "Empty"), however, he/she is not allowed to leave the question or answer choice blank. If the user does leave it blank, then an error message will appear when he/she presses the done button. If the user wants to simply modify the current flashcard then the user can click on the pencil emoji on the question/answer box and it will lead the user to a the screen with the boxes of question and answer choices that already has the current question and answer choices already prefilled inside the boxes.
