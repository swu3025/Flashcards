## Lab 1

### App Description
This app is a flashcard app that contains a question on the screen of the the app with three answer choices below. The user of the app has two options: click on the answer choices below or directly reveal the answer to the question. If the answer choice tapped on is wrong, the answer choice will disappear. If the answer choice tapped on is the correct answer, the question box will be replace with the answer box and the answer choice will have a green background, removing all of the answer choices except for the correct one. To directly access the answer, the user is able to tap on the question box, which will cause the question box to be replace with the answer box.
